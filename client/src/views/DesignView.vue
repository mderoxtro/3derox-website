    <p>Have an idea that you'd like brought to life, either just as a digital 3D Model, or a physically printed 3D Prototype?  A part for a car that isn't currently listed in the parts that we offer?  Custom designs, custom colors, or something completely different?  We'd be happy to help!</p>
    <p>3DeRox is always looking to expand and broaden our offerings.  We would love to discuss things at your convenience - no charge for consultation, discussion, or brainstorming, and we won't pester you endlessly with emails or phone calls if we don't hear anything back, or sell your information.</p>
    <p>For some past examples of the things we're able to do, take a look at the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section.  There's a little bit of everything - fully 3D Modelled cars, movable parts from a reference, custom designs, and product design from a concept.</p>
    <p>Send an email to 3DeRox and we can get the ball rolling: <a href="mailto:admin@3derox.com">Admin@3DeRox.com</a></p>
