    <h1>The Past</h1>
    <p>3DeRox LLC was formed in May of 2021 by Matthew DeRoxtro, a Floridian with a passion for 3D Modelling and vehicle restoration.</p>
    <p>The story began with a 1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA.  It was a money pit, with decades of questionable modifications and abuse.  In what was probably a <i>really bad decision</i>, Matt decided to try and restore the car.  It needed one of everything.  It took years - money - energy, learning new skills, and occasionally blood.</p>
    <p>Eventually, most of the mechanical issues were sorted.  The engine ran, the transmission and exhaust didn't leak, and the rust was dead and gone.  With the metal things fixed, it was time to work on the plastic things.  The first issue: the front up stops for the glass in both doors had broken off, and raising the windows caused them to pop out.  The problem: the front up stops didn't exist.  No OER available, no OEM available, the only option was to scavenge from a junkyard and get another 30+ year old part that would probably break.</p>
    <p>Not one to let a small plastic piece that he couldn't find replacements for anywhere stop the illusion of progress on his project car, Matt decided on a whim to invest in a 3D Printer and try to replicate the part.  Using the broken pieces of his original part, measurements from the car, and a history of 3D Design, he was able to engineer and print out a replica, and <i>it worked</i>.</p>
    <p>Maybe there were other people out there, working on these same cars, that needed this part too?  A regular lurker on <a href="http://www.thirdgen.org">thirdgen.org</a>, Matt posted his success, and some people were interested.  Seeing a means to combine his passions and make money at the same time, Matt formed 3DeRox LLC and began selling parts.</p>
    <h1>The Present</h1>
    <p>3DeRox has a presence on <a href="http://https://www.ebay.com/usr/md3derox">eBay</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/3DeRox">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/3derox">Facebook</a>, and a catalog of 14 different parts available for sale.  Across all storefronts, 3DeRox LLC has made over 100 sales, across most of the United States and as far as The Netherlands and Australia from its humble beginnings in Mulberry, Florida.</p>
    <p>The Trans Am is still in progress, now with a fresh coat of paint, a new set of tires, and the daunting task of the entirety of the interior left to accomplish.  Matt is still reverse engineering parts that are difficult to find as he encounters them, adding them to the catalog as he goes.</p>
    <p>The fleet of 3D Printers has grown, as has the investment in materials and other portions of the business, as well as side projects with design work in alternate industries.</p>
    <h1>The Future</h1>
    <p>Continued Growth - a larger catalog of parts and wider variety of materials, crossing over to additional vehicles, additional printers for additional capacity, a larger online presence to include social media.</p>
    <p>Additional Services - offering custom design services to alternate industries and taking requests for parts as opposed to create-when-needed.</p>
    <p>New Website Experience - featuring a store, detailed information about all parts available, and general professional appearance compared to the placeholder that looks like it was made in 1998 on Angelfire.</p>
